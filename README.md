# About

This is a basic Node.js server setup with Express, Mongoose and TypeScript.

TypeScript configuration can be found in `tsconfig.json` file.

Package `ts-node-dev` is used to automatically re-start the server when code changes.

All route handlers and controller functions are in `index.ts` file.

For better refactored setup, see other branches.
